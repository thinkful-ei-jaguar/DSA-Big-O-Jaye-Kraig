1.1 O(1),  because since everyone can hear you, you only have to say it once and you'll receive feedback immediately

1.2 O(n), because you're asking people one by one and the more people there are, the more time it will take

2. O(1), because it is only doing one operation to return true or false

3. O(n^2), because of the nested for loops

4. O(n), because you are always going the length of the array everytime

5. O(1), because it is not doing any operation

6. O(n^2), because of the nested for loops

7. O(n), 

8. O(log(n)), 

9. O(1),
